## New Bonus Actions

### Aim
You can use your bonus action to more carefully line up a ranged attack. When you do so, select a target within line of sight and not behind total cover. Your ranged weapon attacks reduce partial cover by one step (from three-quarters to half, half to one-quarter, one-quarter to ignored) until the start of your next turn. 

You lose the benefits of Aim if you lose line of sight to your target or if you take any other actions other than ranged weapon attacks. Aiming provides no benefit when making a Burst or Rapid attack.

### Brace
Using your bonus action you may Brace a weapon with the Burst or Rapid property. 
 
When you Brace a weapon, your speed is reduced by half and you no longer suffer Disadvantage on your attack roll when making a Burst or Rapid attack with that weapon until the start of your next turn.
