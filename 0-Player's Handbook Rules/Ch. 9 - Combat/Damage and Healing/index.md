# Damage and Healing

## Droids and Death (NEW)
Unlike living beings, Droids do not "Die," but can be disabled or destroyed. 
 - If a Droid is reduced to 0 hit points and then fails its third death saving throw, rather than die it is instead disabled and cannot be reactivated until it is repaired by another creature using [Astromech's Implements](). 
 - If a droid suffers instant death, it is instead irrepairably destroyed.

## Knocking a Creature Out (REVISED)
Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. 

When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with one of the following, they can knock the creature out.
- A melee attack (weapon, force, or tech)
- A blaster weapon that deals ion or energy damage
- A ranged force attack that deals force, kinetic, or sonic damage
- A ranged tech attack that deals cold, ion, or sonic damage 

The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.
