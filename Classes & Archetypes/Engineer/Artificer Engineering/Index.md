## ARTIFICER ENGINEERING

Those engineers who choose the Artificer Engineering discipline focus on building and modifying lightsabers, while tapping into the latent presence of the Force in these lightsaber crystals. This inspires them to emulate the power of the Force with their technology, and some even awaken latent Force potential within themselves.

### Bonus Proficiencies
***Armstech Engineering:*** *3rd level*

You gain proficiency in artificer’s implements, medium armor, and simple and martial lightweapons. Additionally, when you engage in crafting with artificer’s implements, the rate at which you craft doubles.

### Modified Lightweapon
***Armstech Engineering:*** *3rd level*

You learn to modify one unenhanced lightweapon utilizing your artificer knowledge. Over the course of a long rest, you can modify your lightweapon. You must have the lightweapon and artificer’s implements in order to perform this modification.

Your modified lightweapon is enhanced, requires attunement, can only be used by you, and counts as a tech focus for your tech powers while you are attuned to it. Your modified lightweapon has 4 modification slots, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. For each modification installed in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can replace or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).

Some modification effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC.

At 9th level, you can maintain two different modified lightweapons. Each modified weapon has modification slots as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table.

### FORCE RESONANCE
***Artificer Engineering:*** *3rd level*

Once per round, when you hit a creature with your modified lightweapon, you can expend one use of your Potent Aptitude to deal an extra 2d6 damage to that target. The damage is the same type as your modified lightweapon’s damage.

The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3d6 at 5th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 17th level.

### FORCECASTING SECRETS
***Artificer Engineering:*** *6th, 7th, 13th, and 17th level*

Your study of kyber crystals has awakened a latent force sensitivity. Choose two force powers of 1st level. The chosen powers count as tech powers for you, and you do not need to know any listed prerequisite powers to learn them, but they are not included in the number in the Powers Known column of the engineer table.


At 7th level, you learn two additional force powers of 1st or 2nd level. At 13th level, you learn two force powers of 1st-3rd level, and at 17th level, you learn two force powers of 1st-4th level. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the force powers you know and replace it with another force power of the same level.

### DISRUPTIVE RESONANCE
***Artificer Engineering:*** *14th level*

When you hit a creature that is concentrating on a power with your modified lightweapon, the creature has disadvantage on the Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration. Additionally, on a failed save, the creature immediately takes psychic damage equal to half your engineer level + your Intelligence modifier.

### RESONATING RECOVERY
***Artificer Engineering:*** *18th level*

Once per turn, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you regain a use of your Potent Aptitude. Your number of Potent Aptitude uses can not exceed your proficiency bonus.

### Artificer Modifications
If a modification has prerequisites, you must meet them to install it. You can install the modification at the same time that you meet its prerequisites.

#### ADDITIONAL BEAM PORT
***Prerequisite:*** *Lightsaber Simple Lightweapon*

You install a second beam port into your modified lightsaber. Your modified lightsaber gains the double (1d8) property and loses the versatile property if it has it. You can only benefit from this property while wielding your modified lightsaber with two hands.

#### ADEGAN CRYSTAL
***Prerequisite:*** *5th level*

You gain a +1 bonus to damage rolls made with this weapon. This bonus increases to +2 at 9th level and +3 at 13th level.

#### ADVANCED CRYOSABER
***Prerequisite:*** *15th level, Prototype Cryosaber*

You further fine tune your cryosaber. While activated, your modified lightweapon coats the area within 5 feet of it in a sheet of slippery ice, making it difficult terrain that you treat as normal terrain.

Additionally, when you activate this conversion to alter the properties of your lightweapon and use a bonus action to attempt to slow your target, every creature of your choice within 5 feet of you must also make a Dexterity saving throw to avoid being slowed.

#### ADVANCED DISRUPTORSABER
***Prerequisite:*** *15th level, Prototype Disruptorsaber*

You further fine tune your disruptorsaber. While activated, your modified lightweapon lightly obscures the area within 5 feet of it.

Additionally, when you activate this conversion to alter the properties of your lightweapon and use a bonus action to attempt to knock your target prone, the next saving throw you make before the end of your next turn has advantage.

Additionally, when you activate this conversion to alter the properties of your lightweapon and use a bonus action to attempt to blind your target, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage.

#### BARRIER
***Prerequisite:*** *5th level*

On your turn, when you make an attack roll with your modified lightweapon, you can choose to forgo your proficiency bonus. If you do, you can use your reaction to erect a temporary barrier that lasts until the start of your next turn. While the barrier is activated, you have a bonus to AC against the first attack roll made against you equal to your proficiency bonus.

Additionally, the creature attempting to activate must make on a Constitution saving throw or take lightning damage equal to engineer level, and become shocked until the start of its next turn. On a successful save the creature takes half damage and is not shocked. Regardless of success or failure, the creature drops your modified lightweapon.

# CHANGELOG

## Differences From 1.0

This archetype revision has some differences from the currently existing Artificer archetype that may not be readily apparent. These changes are summarized below.
* Bonus Proficiencies (3rd level) now adds proficiency with all simple and martial lightweapons--not just the lightsaber simple lightweapon--as well as medium armor.
* Modified Lightweapon (3rd level) is an upgrade of Modified Lightsaber that allows for all lightweapons to be modified, not just the simple lightsaber. This brings the archetype in line with similar archetypes like Armstech.
* Force Resonance (3rd level) has been downgraded; its damage dice scale less steeply now.
* Forcecasting Secrets (6th level) has been upgraded; at-will prerequisites for force powers can now be ignored.
* Disruptive Resonance (14th level) has been downgraded; it now deals half engineer level in psychic damage instead of the full level.
* The modifications Additional Beam Port, Comfortable Handle and Greatsaber Array have been restricted to working on the lightsaber simple lightweapon only. This way, existing artificers won't have to alter their current weapons if they don't want to, and the current method of maximizing the potential of a lightsaber remains.
* The modifications Additional Beam Port and Greatsaber Array now remove the lightsaber's versatile property.
* The modification Blastsaber Conversion (and its Prototype and Advanced versions) has been removed.
* The modifications Cryosaber Conversion (and its Prototype and Advanced versions), Fusion Shunt, Fusion Welding Adjustment, Helisaber Attachment, Hilt Blaster, Light Cell, Stabilizer Cell and Waterproof Casing have been added.
* The modification Brightsaber Conversion (and its Prototype and Advanced versions) has been renamed to Flaresaber Conversion.
* The modification Returning Weapon has been renamed to Returning Weapon Hilt.
* The modification Intense Beam now properly describes the keen 1 property, no longer requires the modification Burn Through, and is now 7th level instead of 11th.


In summary, three abilities have been upgraded, four abilities renamed, two abilities downgraded, one modification renamed, three modifications changed, three modifications removed and ten modifications added.
