# Engineer

### Infuse Items
*2nd-level Engineer*

You've learned how to modify and create mundane items to utilize a variety of enhanced effects through Engineer Modifications.

#### Modifications Known

When you gain this feature, pick four Engineer Modifications to learn, choosing from the "Engineer Modifications" section at the end of the class's description. You learn additional Engineer Modifications of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class, two more at 6th level (6 total), two at 11th level (8 total) and two at 16th level (10 total).

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one known Engineer Modification with a new one.

#### Engineer Modifications

Engineers have invented numerous modifications, extraordinary processes that rapidly create enhanced items and modify existing ones. To many, Engineers seem like wonderworkers, accomplishing in hours what others need weeks to complete.

The description of each of the following Engineer Modifications detailnthe type of item ot creates or that can receive it, along with whether the resulting enhanced item requires attunement.

Some infusions specify a minimum Engineer level. You can't learn such an Engineer Modification until you have at least that many levels in Engineer.

Unless a modification's description says otherwise, you can't learn an Engineer Modification more than once.

#### Modifying an Item

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a mundane object and imbue it with one of your Engineer Modifications, turning it into an enhanced item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the Engineer Modification's description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you modifiy the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see "Attunement" in Wretched Hives).

Your Engineer Modification remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the modification vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The modification also vanishes if you give up your knowledge of the Engineer Modification for another one.

You can modify more than one mundane object at the end of a long rest. The maximum number of objects you can modify is one at 2nd level, two at 6th level, three at 11th level and four at 16th level.

You must touch each of the objects, and each of your Engineer Modifications can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your modifications at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of Engineer Modifications, the oldest modification immediately ends, and then the new modification applies.

If an Engineer Modification ends on an item that contains other things, like a bag of holding, its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space.

### Tool Expertise
*2nd level Engineer*

You gain expertise in Tinker's implements, your chosen 1st level Engineer tool proficiency, and your engineering discipline's specialized tool(s). 

If you would already have expertise in one of these tools, you can choose a different tool of the same type you have proficiency in.
