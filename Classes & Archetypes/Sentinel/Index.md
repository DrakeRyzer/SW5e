```The current Battle Readiness feature to be replaced with Iron Sentinel's current Follow Through feature (also to be replaced, as noted below) and renamed to Force Readiness.```

## Force Readiness
***Sentinel:** 10th level*<br>
*You hav learned how to meld your physical self with the Force.* 

When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 2 force points and forgo one of your attacks to cast an at-will force power which requires you to make a melee weapon attack.

```The current Battle Readiness feature will instead become a new Ideal.```
### Ideal of the Zealous
Whenever you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 2 force points to cast an at-will power as a bonus action.

Additionally, as a bonus action, you can manifest this ideal in a brief surge of energy. For the next minute, when you take the Dodge or Disengage actions, or use your action to cast a force power, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.

```Iron Sentinel's current Follow Through feature will be replaced with the following.```
### Follow Through
***Path of Iron:** 13th level*
