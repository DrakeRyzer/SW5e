### Upgrading Enhanced Items
*Modifiable items* can have their rarity upgraded over time. An item can only be upgraded by someone proficient with the appropriate tools, and it can only be upgraded one rarity step at a time. Upgrading a *Modifiable item* takes eight hours and requires an ability check with the appropriate tool. The DC for the check is determined by the rarity to which the *Modifiable item* is being upgraded, as shown in the [*Installation/Removal DC by Rarity*](https://drakeryzer.github.io/DrakeSW5E/Enhanced%20Items/Modifiable%20Items/#installationremoval-dc-by-rarity) table. Additionally, upgrading the rarity of a *Modifiable item* requires an appropriate rare material, as discussed in the *Crafting* downtime activity. Upgrading a *Modifiable item* has no effect on any Item Mods currently installed in the *Modifiable item*.

On a success, the *Modifiable item* is upgraded to the new rarity. On a failure, the *Modifiable item* is not upgraded, you must wait 24 hours before you can try again, and you must roll a d20. If you roll a 1 on the d20, one currently installed Item Mod is destroyed. If the *Modifiable Item* has more than one Item Mod installed, the GM should determine which Item Mod is destroyed randomly.
