# Cybernetics
Some characters are dissatisfied with their inborn gifts, while some are simply looking to supplement their natural prowess. The less fortunate, however, might find themselves missing a limb. For all of these characters, cybernetics suit a purpose.

### Cybernetic Categories
Two major categories of cybernetics exist in the galaxy: enhancements and replacements.

#### Enhancements
Enhancements bestow new abilities or improve the recipient in some fashion. Enhancements include skeletal reinforcement, subcutaneous communications hardware, and weapon mounts. Some have visible external components, while others are hidden beneath the skin. 

#### Replacements
Replacements are prosthetic or artificial units intended to replace limbs and damaged organs. Common replacements provide no benefits other than duplicating the essential functions of their biological counterparts. In appearance, a cybernetic replacement could be recognizably artificial or virtually indistinguishable from the real thing. 

Additionally, traits of your species are retained if that limb or organ is replaced. For instance, a Chiss retains Darkvision when replacing its eyes. However your GM may rule otherwise.

### Enhancing Creatures
Enhancing a creature with cybernetics requires three key components: a valid target for the cybernetic, a cybernetic item to install, and biotech's implements. A creature can only be modified by someone with proficiency in biotech's implements.

#### Cybernetic Limit
A creature can support a number of cybernetics up to their Cybernetic Limit which is equal to their proficiency bonus. Typically, only beasts and humanoids can have cybernetics installed.

#### Operation Time
It takes 8 hours to install a cybernetic in a Medium creature. The time it takes to install a cybernetic in a creature of another size varies based on the size of the target, as shown below in the Creature Size Time Modifier table below.

##### Creature Size Time Modifier
| Creature Size | Time Modifier |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Tiny  |x 0.25 |
| Small |x 0.5 |
| Medium |x 1 |
| Large |x 2 |
| Huge |x 5 |
| Gargantuan |x 10 |

For instance, to install a cybernetic in a Medium creature takes 8 hours. To install a cybernetic in a Huge creature, however, it takes 40 hours (5 x 8).

The installer works 8 hours per day. It costs 100 credits per hour if the operation is performed by an NPC. 

#### Side Effects
In addition to the side effects associated with each cybernetic, your body undergoes changes, depending on how many cybernetics you adopt, as shown below in the Cybernetic Side Effects table.

##### Cybernetic Side Effects
|Number of<br> Cybernetics&nbsp;|Side Effect|
|:--:|:--|
|2|You have disadvantage on saving throws against effects that deal ion damage.|
|4|You have vulnerability to ion damage.|
|6|You count as a droid for powers that affect only droids or constructs.|

### Installing Cybernetics
Installing a cybernetic also requires an ability check with biotech's implements. The DC for the check is determined by the rarity of the cybernetic being installed, as shown in the *Installation/Removal DC by Rarity* table on page 75.

On a success, the cybernetic is correctly installed. On a failure, the cybernetic is not installed, the time and credits are spent, and you must wait 24 hours before you can try again.

Additionally, on a failure, the recipient suffers another effect, depending on the type of cybernetic:
- **Enhancement:** On a failure, the recipient suffers one level of exhaustion.
- **Replacement:** On a failure, the recipient loses the ability to use the part being replaced for a period of time equal to the time it would take to install the replacement. For instance, to install an arm replacement in a Huge creature it takes 40 hours, performed over five days. If, at the end of the five day period, the installer fails the ability check, the Huge creature loses the ability to use that arm for five days. 

### Removing Cybernetics
Removing a cybernetic takes half the time and credits it would to install, and requires an ability check with biotech's implements. The DC for the check is determined by the rarity of the cybernetic being removed, as shown in the *Installation/Removal DC by Rarity* table on page 75.

On a success, the cybernetic is removed and salvaged. On a failure, the cybernetic is removed but destroyed.

Additionally, when removing a replacement cybernetic, the recipient loses the ability to use the missing part until it receives another suitable replacement.

## Biotech Engineers
A Biotech Engineering Engineer uses the following rules when using Enhanced Cybernetics:
- *Enhanced Cybernetics* can be installed past your *Cybernetic Limit* (as described under *Cybernetics*) using your *Total Mods* for this archetype.
- *Enhanced Cybernetics* still count towards the *Cybernetic Side Effects table*.
- *Biotech Engineering Cybernetics* do not count towards the *Cybernetic Side Effects table*.
- Biotech Enginners can apply the effects of both their *Biotech Engineering Cybernetics* as well as *Enhanced Cybernetics* from this book, to a maximum bonus of 3.

A Biotech Engineer using the *Variant: Droids* rule from their archetype, would instead replace Enhanced Cybernetics with Enhanced Droid Customizations for the above rules.
