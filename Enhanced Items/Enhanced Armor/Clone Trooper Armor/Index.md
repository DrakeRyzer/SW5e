# Clone Trooper Armor
Clone Trooper Armor was the armor worn by clone troopers of the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars.  With some design assistance from Jango Fett, the basic armor design became composed of twenty form-fitting plates of lightweight plastoid-alloy composite, sealed to a black bodysuit, and loosely resembled Mandalorian shock Trooper Armor.  Phase I Clone armor was heavy, uncomfortable, and not very well liked by the clone troopers, replaced by Phase II later in the war.  Their helmets and armor were fairly modular, being able to support various attachments.  Other types existed, such as the Alpha-class ARC Trooper Armor and Katarn-class armor, as well as more specialized variants of the Phase I and II armor types.
