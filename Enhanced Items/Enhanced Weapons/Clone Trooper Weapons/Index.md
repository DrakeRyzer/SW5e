# Clone Trooper Weapons
---

## Carbines

### DC-15A Blaster Carbine
***Weapon** (heavy carbine or blaster carbine), <font style="color:lime">premium</font>*

When you deal damage with this weapon, you deal an additional 1d4 ion damage.

*One of the standard-issue weapons for the clone troopers during the Clone Wars, the DC-15A was a reliable blaster capable of both sustained fire and slower, long-range accuracy.*

### DC-19 Stealth Carbine 
***Weapon** (stealth carbine), <font style="color:cyan">prototype</font>*

You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with this weapon. Additionally, when you deal damage with this weapon, you deal an additional 1d4 ion damage and attacks with this weapon made while hidden no longer require a contested check to stay hidden.

*The DC-19 was equipped with a sound suppressor unit for silent operations and an optional stealth function, which used a refined tibanna gas mixture that made the DC-19's plasma bolts invisible to the naked eye.*

## Rifles

### DC-15A Blaster Rifle
***Weapon** (heavy blaster rifle), <font style="color:lime">premium</font>*

When you deal damage with this weapon, you deal an additional 1d4 ion damage.

*One of the standard-issue weapons of the Galactic Republic's clone troopers, this blaster was a larger, heavier and more powerful long-range alternative to the DC-15A blaster carbine.*

### DC-15LE Blaster Rifle
***Weapon** (heavy blaster rifle), <font style="color:cyan">prototype</font>*

You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with this weapon and it loses the burst property. Additionally, hit or miss, the blaster bolt then explodes. The target and each creature within 5 feet must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d6 ion damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.

*The DC-15LE was a blaster rifle and variant of the standard DC-15A blaster rifle, which could fire explosive blaster bolts.*

### DC-15X Sniper Rifle
***Weapon** (sniper rifle), <font style="color:lime">premium</font>*

When you deal damage with this weapon, you deal an additional 1d4 ion damage.

*Featuring additional sights, the DC-15x boasted exceptional accuracy and fired powerful blue, hyper-ionized plasma bolts that were highly effective against droids and organics alike.*

## Pistols
### DC-17 hand blaster
***Weapon** (hand blaster), <font style="color:cyan">prototype</font>*

You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with this weapon. Additionally, when you deal damage with this weapon, you deal an additional 1d4 ion and 1d4 energy damage.

*Capable of a much higher rate of sustained fire than its predecessors, the DC-17 was known for its efficiency and deadliness.*

### DC-15s side arm blaster
***Weapon** (light pistol), <font style="color:cyan">prototype</font>*

You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with this weapon. Additionally, when you deal damage with this weapon, you deal an additional 1d4 ion damage and every two rounds this blaster adds one to its reload.

*While not as powerful as regular DC-15 blasters; the DC-15s was handy in close-quarters combat or when conserving ammo was necessary as the energy cell kept the blaster recharging at a slow but steady rate.*

## Heavy Blasters

### Reciprocating Quad Blaster - "Cip-Quad"
***Weapon** (blaster cannon), <font style="color:cyan">prototype</font>* <br> *Requires Attunement*

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with this enhanced weapon and this weapon’s strength number is reduced by two steps (from 19 to 15) and is also reduced when deployed (from 15 to 11).

Additionally, when you deal damage with this weapon, you deal an additional 1d4 ion damage and you can make one attack with it as a bonus action on each of your turns.
