# Enhanced Items

If you're searching for Mandalorian themed items, check the [EC Mandalorian Codex](<../EC Mandalorian Codex>) under [Mandalorian Armory](<../EC Mandalorian Codex/Mandalorian Armory>)

## Enhanced Item Formatting Guide

The following table lists the various Suffixes Enhanced Items might use based on their rarity. (Generally only for items with Multiple Rarities, as described below)

#### Naming Conventions

|Rarity|Suffix 1|Suffix 2|Suffix 3|Suffix 4|Suffix 5|
|:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|<font style="color:gray">**Standard**</font>|(Basic)|(Minor)|(Novice)|(Cracked)|(Mk I)|
|<font style="color:lime">**Premium**</font>|(Fine)|(Average)|(Apprentice)|(Chipped)|(Mk II)|
|<font style="color:cyan">**Prototype**</font>|(Improved)|(Major)|(Journeyman)|(Flawed)|(Mk III)|
|<font style="color:fuchsia">**Advanced**</font>|(Superior)|(Deadly)|(Adept)|(Regular)|(Mk IV)|
|<font style="color:orange">**Legendary**</font>|(Exceptional)|(Lethal)|(Master)|(Flawless)|(Mk V)|
|<font style="color:red">**Artifact**</font>|(Champion)|(Devastating)|(Ancient)|(Perfect)|(Mk VI)|

The following Suggested DCs table shows a Game Master what Saving Throw or Ability Check DC an Enhanced Item might have based on its Rarity. This is only a general rule as some effects might have a higher or lower DC if its effect is weaker or stronger than other items. 

#### Suggested DCs

|Rarity|Reusable DC|Consumable DC|
|:--|:--:|:--:|
|<font style="color:gray">**Standard**</font>|13|13|
|<font style="color:lime">**Premium**</font>|14|15|
|<font style="color:cyan">**Prototype**</font>|15|17|
|<font style="color:fuchsia">**Advanced**</font>|16|19|
|<font style="color:orange">**Legendary**</font>|17|21|
|<font style="color:red">**Artifact**</font>|18|23|

### Items With Multiple Rarities 
While most Enhanced Items have a singular Rarity. Some Enhanced Items, such as Item Modifications, have improved versions at higher rarities that a Game Master can add into their campaign. These items will list their respective rarities as well as the additional effects they might recieve at those rarities. Below is an example Item Modification using this Multiple Rarties formatting.

> ### +1 Weapon
> *Generic variant (any mundane weapon), <font style="color:lime">premium</font>/<font style="color:cyan">prototype</font>/<font style="color:fuchsia">advanced</font>*
> 
> You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this enhanced weapon.
> 
> **Higher Rarities:** The weaponâ€™s bonus increases to +2 at protoype rarity (+2 Weapon) and +3 at advanced rarity (+3 Weapon).


## Item Type/Subtype
Subtypes vary based on the item type.

### Armor
Armor subtypes include the following:
- *(battle armor)*, *(mesh armor)*, (battle armor), etc, if it is for a specific armor.
- *(any light armor)*, *(any medium armor)*, or *(any heavy armor)*, if it is valid for a category.
- *(any)*, if it is valid for any armor.

### Cybernetic Augmentations
Cybernetic augmentation subtypes include the following:
- (replacement) if replacing a body part and stipulate what they replace in the item features or flavortext.
- (enhancement) if not it is not replacing any body part.

### Consumables
Consumable subtypes should stipulate what they are.
The most common include the following: 
- (adrenal)
- (explosive)
- (medpac)
- (poison)
- (stimpac)

But can include any Enhanced version of a consumable item or an item with a single use.

### Droid Customizations
Droid customization substypes include the following:
- *(part)*
 - if replacing or adding a part and stipulate what part they add or replace in the item features or flavortext.
- *(protocol)* if not it is not adding or replacing any part.

### Equipment (going to break this down more)
Equipment covers any Enhanced Items that don't fall into other categories, such as (boots), (gloves), or a reusable trinket. If the item is worn, the subtype should be the appropriate place it is worn. Otherwise, leave it blank for now.

### Focuses
Focus subtypes include the following.
- (force) which are most commonly focus generators.
- (tech) which are most commonly wristpads.

### Genetic Mutations
Genetic mutations do not exist yet, I am sorry

### Item Mods
Type should be whatever item type followed by Mod, e.g. Lightweapon Mod, Armor Mod, etc. Item Mod for augments. Subtype subtype should be the slot it fills, such as (lens) or (augment).

### Shields
Shield subtype should be specific shield (light shield generator). If valid for any shield, should be (any).

### Weapons
Weapon subtype should either be a specific weapon (lightsaber) or category (any blaster). If valid for any weapon, should be (any)
