# Vibroweapon Mods

### Adaptive Counterweight
*Item Mod (vibroweapon), <font style="color:cyan">prototype</font>*
<br> *Prerequisite:* Has dexterity and lacks finesse and heavy properties

The dexterity property of this weapon becomes the strength property, retaining the same number it had previously. If a Mod or feature reduces the dexterity property of this weapon, it instead reduces the strength property.

Additionally, when making an attack with a weapon with this property, you use your your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls.
