> **AUTHOR'S NOTE:** For anyone using the old/current Modifiable Items rules, the major change is the removal of Modifiable Items/Chassis'. Instead Item Modifications are items that can just be popped into a matching Item type. As an example: an Adegan Crystal (Chipped) can be installed into any lightweapon, rather than specifically only those considered "Modifiable. The rules here go further in-depth, but that is the gist.

# Item Modifications
While many Unenhanced and Enhanced Items come with fixed effects. Certain Enhanced Items, called Item Modifications, allow you to customize specific types of items you find on your adventures such as weapons and armor. 

## Modifiying an Item
In general, all items, mundane or enhanced, come with four Item Modification Slots; some items might have less and will say so in their text. The type of Item Modifications an item has slots for varies by item type, described under Types of Item Modifications.

Modifying an item requires three things: an Item Modification to install, an item matching its type, and the appropriate tools for those items.

An item can only be modified by someone proficient with the appropriate tools, as shown in the *Types of Item Modifications* table.

For example: to install an Accuracy Focus Mk II you require a Blaster Rifle and a set of Armstech's Implements.

### Types of Item Modifications
Item Modifications can be found as mundane or enhanced items. The following section details not only the types of Item Modifications but also the Item Modification Slots each item type has.

## Modifiable Item slots

Mods by item type
The Item Modifications available vary for each individual item type. For instance, a Blaster Rifle always has four Item Modification slotsâ€”targeting, barrel, core, and attachment and up to two augment slots, determined by its rarity. Augments are universal across all modifiable items, while targeting, barrel, core, and attachment are unique to blasters.

Armor shares three of their Mod slots with shields, while one is unique.
- Overlay. Overlay Mods augment armor and shield's bonus to melee AC.
- Underlay. Underlay Mods augment armor and shield's bonus to ranged AC.
- Reinforcement and Armoring. Reinforcement is shared by armor and shields while armoring is unique to armor. These Mods offer a new feature to armor, or enhance an existing one.

blaster Mods
The following Mod slots are unique to blasters.
- Targeting. Targeting Mods augment a blaster's bonus to attack rolls.

- Cell and Hilt. These Mods offer a new feature to a lightweapon, or enhance an existing one.

- Underlay. Underlay Mods augment armor and shield's bonus to ranged AC.
- Reinforcement and Shielding. Reinforcement is shared by armor and shields while shielding is unique to shields. These Mods offer a new feature to shields, or enhance an existing one.

- Edge. Edge Mods augment a vibroweapon's bonus to damage rolls.
- Oscillator and Guard. These Mods offer a new feature to a vibroweapon, or enhance an existing one.

wristpad Mods

- Motherboard. Motherboard Mods augment a wristpad's bonus to tech save DC.
- Amplifier and Dataport. These Mods offer a new feature to wristpads.



Every Item can install up to two Item Mods, determined by its type, in addition to Augments. Additionaly, installing an Item Mod into an item causes that item to require Attunement if it didn't already.```Item Mods are no longer restricted by Rarity, allowing any Rarity of Item Mod to be installed into any Rarity of item (including unenhanced)```

When two or more Mods with the same effects are installed into an item, only the most potent effects apply. For example, if Mod A adds +1 to damage and Mod B adds +2 to damage, only the +2 to damage applies, giving the weapon +2 bonus to damage rolls rather than +3. Additionally, if Mod A instead has +1 to damage and keen 1, it would still apply keen 1 to the item. 

However, negative bonuses are always applied. For instance: if Mod A instead has -1 to damage and +1 to attack rolls and Mod B adds +2 to damage, the -1 to damage still applies, resulting in only +1 to damage with the weapon.

## Installing and Removing Mods

Installing or Removing an Item Mod takes one hour and requires an ability check with the appropriate tool, as shown in the *Types of Item Mods* table. The DC for the check is determined by the rarity of the Item Mod being installed, as shown below in the [*Installation/Removal DC by Rarity*](https://drakeryzer.github.io/DrakeSW5E/Enhanced%20Items/Modifiable%20Items/#installationremoval-dc-by-rarity) table.

- On a successful installation, the Item Mod is correctly installed. On a failure, the Item Mod is not installed, and you must wait 24 hours before you can try again.
- On a successful removal, the Item Mod is removed and salvaged. On a failure, the Item Mod is removed but destroyed.

# Engineers and Item Mods
Many Engineer archetypes are built around modifying a specific item, such as an Armstech or Armormech Engineer. If you have any of these engineers at the table, while using this book, you'll want to include the following rules:
- An Engineer's class-specific *Modified Item* only ever counts as one Attunement, regardless of the rarity of the Mods inside it.
- An Engineer's class-specific *Modified Item* is not restricted to using *Enhanced Item Mods* of a certain rarity. 
  - For instance, if a 4th-level armstech engineer comes across an artifact rarity blaster Mod, and they are skilled enough to install it, they can benefit from it.
- An Engineer's class-specific *Modified Item* can include up to two augments, which count towards their *Total Mods*.
- *Enhanced Item Mods* installed into an Engineer's class-specific *Modified Item*, must still be installed over time with a successful ability check.
- An Engineerâ€™s class-specific *Modified Item* can apply the effects of both their class-specific Mods as well as *Enhanced Item Mods* from this book, to a maximum bonus of 3. 
  - For instance, an Armstech Engineer with their Accuracy Focus class-specific Mod, as well as the Accuracy Focus Mk II enhanced Mod applies the +1 to weapon attacks from both, for a total of +2 at 5th-level or +3 at 9th level, but not to +4 at 13-level. However, the bonuses from two or more *Enhanced Mods* are still limited to the highest values and negatives are still applied.


# Color Crystals
In addition to the Mods unique to themselves, all lightweapons come with an additional slot for a color crystal. Typically, newly created lightweapons come with one of the more common color variants, such as green, blue, or red. 

Occasionally, a character might come across a more scarce color crystal. When determining what color crystal a lightweapon comes with or is found as loot, the GM can choose for the player, or have the player make a universal forcecasting ability check with proficiency. The result of the check affects the color of the crystal, as shown below in the [Forcecasting Color Crystal Modifier](https://drakeryzer.github.io/DrakeSW5E/Enhanced%20Items/Modifiable%20Items/#forcecasting-color-crystal-modifier) table.

#### Forcecasting Color Crystal Modifier

|Forcecasting<br> Ability Check DC|d100 Roll<br>Item modifier|
|:--:|:--:|
| 1|-15|
| 5|-10|
|10| -5|
|15|  0|
|20| +5|
|25|+10|
|30|+20|> The **d100 Roll Modifier** is added to the percentile dice rolled for the Color Crystal table, which is discussed below.

Once a player has made their forcecasting ability check to discover a lightweapon color crystal, the player rolls percentile dice and consults the Color Crystal table below, applying a modifier based on the result of their forcecasting ability check.

#### Color Crystal

|d100|Crystal Color|d100|Crystal Color|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|1-20|Blue|91-93|Viridian|
|21-40|Red|94-96|Cyan|
|41-60|Green|97|Bronze|
|61-70|Yellow|98|Silver|
|71-80|Purple|99|White|
|81-90|Orange|100+|Black|> This table includes the most common and desirable color crystals. More extensive options can be awarded at the discretion of the GM.

A player can choose the color crystal that is the result of their percentile dice rolled, or they can choose one that falls below it. For instance, if the player rolls a 91 and finds a viridian color crystal, they could instead choose a yellow color crystal, as if they had rolled a 63.<img src='../../zzImages/kybercrystalcave.png' style='float:; bottom:-5px; right:0px; width:1000px;'/>
