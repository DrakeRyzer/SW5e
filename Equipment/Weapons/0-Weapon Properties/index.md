# Weapon Properties

## Reworks

### Burst
When you would make a ranged weapon attack with a weapon with this property, you can instead spray a creature and those surrounding it with shots.

The attack is made with disadvantage, regardless of circumstance, and you consume ammunition equal to the Burst number. Additionally, each creature within 5 feet of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to the attack roll made with the weapon) or take the weapon’s normal damage.

If you would have advantage on your attack roll, affected creatures instead have disadvantage on their saving throw, and if you would have disadvantage on your attack roll, affected creatures instead have advantage on their saving throw.

### Rapid v1
When you would make a ranged weapon attack with a weapon with this property, you can instead unload multiple shots into a single target.

The attack is made with disadvantage, regardless of circumstance, and you consume ammunition equal to the Rapid number. On a hit, you roll the weapon’s damage dice twice.

### Rapid v2
If you attack with a Rapid weapon as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action immediately after to make a ranged attack with it. This attack deals damage equal on a hit, instead of 2d4.

### Double v1
If you attack with a double weapon as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action immediately after to make another melee attack with it. ***The bonus action attack requires two hands to use and deals 1d4 damage on a hit, instead of its normal weapon damage die. You don’t add your ability modifier to the attack roll of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.***
