### Bipod
*Credits - 200 | Weight 0.5 lb*<br>
A bipod is a device mounted to a two-handed blaster weapon that lacks the fixed property to offer increased stability. While prone or adjacent to low objects (or other waist- to chest-height Cover), you can use your Object Interaction to deploy the bipod. If you move, you lose the bipod's benefits until you prepare it again.

While deployed, the attached weaponâ€™s strength number is reduced by 4 and you cannot be disarmed of the weapon. 

Additionally, a Bipod makes aiming easier. If you have taken the Aim bonus action on your previous turn, each subsequent Aim bonus action can instead be taken as an Object Interaction, targeting the same target. This benefit is lost if you attack or Aim at any other target.

### Tripod
*Credits - 500 | Weight 15.0 lb*<br>
A tripod is a device used to mount a two-handed blaster weapon that lacks the fixed property to offer increased stability. As an action, you can deploy the tripod, attaching it to a surface (such as the ground, a section of floor, or to a vehicle or starship) or collapse it. As a bonus action, you can mount or remove one blaster weapon to it and while mounted the weapon is considered immobile. 

While deployed, you ignore the Strength property of an attached blaster weapon and you have a +10 bonus to ability checks and saving throws to avoid being disarmed of the weapon.

Additionally, a tripod makes aiming easier. If you have taken the Aim bonus action on your previous turn, each subsequent Aim bonus action can instead be taken as an Object Interaction, targeting the same target. This benefit is lost if you attack or Aim at any other target.
