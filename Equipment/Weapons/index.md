# Weapons
Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class's focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a vibroweapon or a blaster, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring. The Weapons tables show the most common weapons used in the worlds of *Star Wars*, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as a blaster, lightweapon, or vibroweapon. A vibroweapon or lightweapon is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a blaster is used to attack a target at a distance. Lightweapons are generally used in melee, but due to their nature require separate proficiency.

### Weapon Proficiency
Your species, class, feats and other features can grant you proficiency with specific weapons, weapon groups or sub-groups of weapons. 

The two main categories are Melee Weapons and Ranged Weapons which are broken down further into Weapon Groups, described later in this section. Most people can use simple weapons, which are commonly seen in the hands of the unspecialized, with proficiency. Martial weapons, such as bladed lightweapons, crushing vibroweapons or rifles; require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use these weapons because they put their fighting style and training to best use. 

An example of this is a Martial Lightsaber is a specific weapon of the Bladed sub-group of the Martial Lightweapon weapon group.

Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

### Improvised Weapons
Sometimes characters don't have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is close at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead jawa.

In many cases, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such however creatures are not profienct with them unless they have a feature that gives them proficiency in improvised weapons, such as Brawler Style.

At the GM's discretion, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus. An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 kinetic damage. If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

### **Unarmed Strikes**
Regardless of whether or not you are armed, you can make a melee weapon attack called an Unarmed Strike: a punch, kick, head--butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, you deal kinetic damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. You are proficient with your Unarmed Strike.

(GM note)
Additionally, some class features or customization options utilize weapons or attacks with weapons; such as Force Imbuement or Defense Mastery; as well as some items; such as Modifiable Handwraps; can add weapon properties to Unarmed Strikes. Consider allowing these features, effects, and weapon properties to be made with Unarmed Strikes

## Weapon Groups

Below are all Weapon Groups by Category and Subcategories:

### Melee Weapons
**Lightweapons** - Weapons of pure energy or plasma, typically used by Force casters. They come in both Simple and Martial variations.
- **Simple Lightweapons** - Basic Lightweapons that are simple or primitive in nature and use.
- **Martial Lightweapons** - More advanced Lightweapons that require extensive training to wield effectively.
  
**Vibroweapons** - Technologically enhanced melee weapons, primarily using vibration technology. They come in both Simple and Martial variations.
- **Simple Vibroweapons** - Basic Vibroweapons that are simple or primitive in nature and use.
- **Martial Lightweapons** - More advanced Vibroweapons that require extensive training to wield effectively.

### Ranged Weapons
**Ranged Weapons** - These weapons run the gamut from small, concealable handheld blasters to Tripod-mounted assault cannons. They come in both Simple and Martial variations.
- **Simple Ranged Weapons** - Basic ranged weapons that are simple or primitive in nature and use. 
- **Martial Ranged Weapons** - More advanced Lightweapons that require extensive training to wield effectively.

### Exotic Weapons

Exotic weapons are being removed as a mechanic and instead current exotic weapons will be made into Enhanced items, with Multi-Weapon being a new type of enhanced item. This includes the Exotic Weapon Training feat.

## Weapon Focus and Weapon Supremacy

Additionally, some features such as Weapon Focus and Weapon Supremacy call for a specific sub-group of weapons. Each weapon has at least one sub-group, although some weapons can fall under more than one. If a weapon falls under more than one sub-group, you can only benefit from features from one sub-group at a time.
- ***-Melee Sub-Groups-***
  - **Bladed** - Your standard Melee weapons such as lightsabers and vibroswords.
  - **Crushing** - More forceful or weighted Melee weapons such as great-sabers and vibromaces.
  - **Polearms** - Melee weapons with long handles or reach such as pikesabers and vibrospears.
  - **Disruptive (formally Tripping)** - Melee weapons specialized in disrupting combat such as saberwhips and vibrodaggers.

- ***-Ranged Sub-Groups-***
  - **Carbines** - Lightweight, short-barreled weapons, made to be more portable and easier to carry than standard rifles.
  - **Heavy Weapons** - Large ranged weapons that require both hands, and in some cases a tripod, to accurately use.
  - **Rifles** - Standard military weapons, used with both hands for precise and accurate shooting.
  - **Sidearms** - Handheld ranged weapons, favored for self-defense, and are easily concealed.
  - **Explosives** - (being considered)
