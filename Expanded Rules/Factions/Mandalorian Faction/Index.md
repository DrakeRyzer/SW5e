## Goals
Mandalorian culture places heavy emphasis on strength and worthiness. The primary goal of a Mandalorian is to prove that their strength is greater than that of others. 

## Beliefs
The Mandalorian's beliefs are characterized by the Resol'nare, or the Six Actions:
- A Mandalorian must wear armor.
- A Mandalorian must speak Mando'a.
- A Mandalorian must defend themself and their
family.
- A Mandalorian must contribute to the overall well-
being of the clan.
- A Mandalorian must raise their children as
Mandalorians.
- A Mandalorian must heed Mandalore's call and
rally to their cause.

## Traits
Mandalorians often share member traits of being strong, hardy, resilient, and uncompromising.

## Insignia
The Mandalorian insignia—the Kyr'bes—features the skull of a mythosaur. It is a badge of honor that Mandalorians wear openly.

## Headquarters
As a society of nomadic soldiers the Mandalorians have a myriad of headquarters throughout the galaxy.  Their primary headquarters is their homeworld of Mandalore, with other planets in the Mandalore System, such as Akaan, Cheravh, Concord Dawn, Dxun, Mandallia, Ordo, and Shogun also falling under their control for much of their known history.  There have also been times where they claim starships, such as the massive starship, the *Spirit of Vengeance*, their home.

## Becoming a Mandalorian
Mandalorians are a large, galaxy-spanning faction, that doesn't rely on active recruitment. Instead, new members tend to seek out Mandalorian clans to join. 

In order to join the Mandalorians, new members must be proficient in at least one martial weapon and require at least one workweek of faction activity downtime a month to retain status.  They must also learn the history and traditions of the Mandalorian people.  

Once they have shown their commitment to learning, they must then prove themselves to be an exceptional warrior.  This can be done by fighting Mandalorians in unarmed combat or by accomplishing a feat of strength against a worthy opponent.

### Maintaining Membership
To remain a Mando'ade you must follow the Resol'nare, or Six Actions, as detailed under Beliefs.
