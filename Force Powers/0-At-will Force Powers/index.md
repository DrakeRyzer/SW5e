## Saber Throw
*At-will universal power*
<br>**Casting Time:** 1 action
<br>**Range:** 30 feet
<br>**Duration:** Instantaneous

As a part of the action used to cast this power, you must make a thrown weapon attack with a lightweapon or vibroweapon you are wielding against one target within the power’s range, otherwise the power fails. The attack can use your forcecasting ability for the attack and damage rolls instead of using Strength or Dexterity. 

On a hit, the target takes normal weapon damage of the same type as the weapon’s damage. The weapon then immediately returns to your hand.

**At-will Scaling:** This power deals additional damage and its range increases when you reach higher levels. 
 - At 5th level, the weapon attack deals an extra 1d6 force damage and its range increases to 60 feet.
 - At 11th level, the weapon attack deals an extra 2d6 force damage and its range increases to 90 feet.
 - At 17th level, the weapon attack deals an extra 3d6 force damage and its range increases to 120 feet.

## True Strike
*At-will universal power*
<br>**Casting Time:** 1 action
<br>**Range:** Self
<br>**Duration:** Instantaneous

Guided by the Force, you make one attack with a lightweapon or vibroweapon you are wielding. The attack uses your forcecasting ability for the attack and damage rolls instead of using Strength or Dexterity. If the attack deals damage, it can be Force damage or the weapon’s normal damage type (your choice).

**At-will Scaling:** Whether you choose to deal Force damage or the weapon’s normal damage	type, the attack deals extra Force damage when you reach levels 5 (1d6), 11 (2d6), and 17 (3d6).
