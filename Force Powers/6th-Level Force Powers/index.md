## Serenity	
*6th-level light power*
<br>**Casting Time:** 1 action
<br>**Target**: Self
<br>**Duration:** Up to 10 minutes (Concentration)

You endow yourself with endurance and martial serenity fueled by the Force. Until the power ends, you gain the following benefits:

- You gain 50 temporary hit points. If any of these remain when the power ends, they are lost.
- Your movement speed increases by 30 feet.
- When you hit a target with a weapon attack, that target takes an extra 2d8 force damage.
- When you cast a force power that restores hit points to a friendly creature, they regain an extra 2d6 hit points.
- You have Immunity to the Frightened and Charmed conditions.
- You have advantage on Wisdom and Charisma saving throws.
- You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn. You ignore this benefit if you already have a feature, like Extra Attack, that gives you extra attacks on the Attack action.

Immediately after the power ends, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion.
