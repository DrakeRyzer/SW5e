{: .label .label-red }# Chapter 2: Starship Basics

This chapter covers some of the basics of starship construction as well as travel through the Galaxy which happen outside of combat, giving players and Game Masters a sense of how starships work in the Star Wars universe.

Game Masters should feel free to use as much or as little of this material as they like; though this section includes information on established protocols and traditions of the Star Wars universe, none of these features are so integral to the central themes of Star Wars that they cannot be ignored if so desired.```Many of the rules found here are derived and modified from D&D 5th Edition's rules as well as Star Wars Saga Edition's Basic Starship rules to fit the SW5e system.```
