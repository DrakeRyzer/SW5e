# Acquiring a Starship
You can make, upgrade, or refit a starship for Star Wars 5th Edition using the building blocks found within these rules.

Before you dive into starship creation, there are a few things to do to get ready, as explained below.

Many parties might only seek passage on hired vessels for transport to travel from planet to planet, and there's nothing wrong with that. Other groups will want to acquire their own starship as soon as they can, either at Character Creation or early on in a campaign. 

It is at the discretion of the Game Masters to determine when a character or party should obtain their first starship using one of the following options as well as the specifics as to their cost in time, credits and favors.

> **A Note on Costs**<br>
> All costs given are, by necessity, approximate. The Star Wars galaxy is a vast market, and it's impossible to create a system that realistically represents the thousands of factors that could affect a major purchase's final cost. As a result, the Game Master should feel free to modify these prices up or down as much as necessary to suit the plot of an adventure, the storyline of a campaign, or even personal preference.

## Purchasing
The most common method of acquiring a starship is by purchasing. The cost of a brand new "stock" starship, with the bare minimum in upgrades and equipment, can be found under each Starship Class page detailed in Chapter 3.

How the players afford the starship varies. They may be patient, earning the credits to make the purchase over time. Alternatively, they might seek a backer, or a loan through a financial institution or any other of the methods described earlier.

## Joining a Faction
Joining a large faction, such as the Galactic Republic or the Empire might merit the acquisition of a personal starship. Generally, the faction still owns the starship and allows the party to use it as long as they are in accordance with the faction's wishes. Refusing missions or violating the faction's rule may lead to disavowment, pursuit, and eventual repossession of the starship. 

## A Wealthy Benefactor
Alternatively, the party may work for a wealthy individual or group, such as an aristocrat or a criminal cartel. Convincing such an person to finance you, however, can be quite the adventure in-and-of itself. Can the party prove that the relationship will be mutually beneficial?

An example of this method can be: In exchange for a load of credits to buy a Starship, the benefactor asks the party to perform tasks until they repay the loan. This situation can lead to a variety of adventure hooks: Perhaps the heroes need to escort a Senator to a dangerous planet, or they need to deliver precious cargo to refugees deep behind enemy lines at the behest of their benefactor.

## Legitimate Financing
The party could seek a loan from a bank to purchase a starship. Generally, 20% of the starship's cost is required as a down payment, with monthly payments equal to 2% of the cost for the following five years. However this also provides an opportunity for the party "face" to attempt to haggle for a better down payment.

## Loan Sharks and Gangsters
As a more dangerous option, a loan shark or an affluent gangster could finance a starship. Usually requiring less money up front, this loan has steeper loan pay-ments (usually at least 10% of the total cost each month for 3 years). But missing payments could mean the party's benefactor sends mercenaries and bounty hunters after them to collect on their debts.

## Shipjacking and Theft
The most nefarious way to acquire a starship is to steal one from a legitimate owner. Which can easily happen before the campaign begins or as the objective of the party's first adventure. 

Shipjacking is an old and extremely dangerous profession. Starport authorities (as well as the original owners) are constantly on the lookout for stolen ships, and if the heroes fail to adequately falsify documentation identifying themselves as the starship's owners, they can find themself in an uncomfortable position.

## Constructiion
Constructing a starship is generally cheaper than buying it, however it requires raw materials, use of a shipyard, an appropritely sized workforce and time to physically construct it. 

If players elect to design or commission the construction of a starship themselves, they choose a Starship Class to base it on, such as a Medium Fighter or a Light Freighter. Constructing a starship requires half the cost in credits of the finished starship, as noted on its respective Starship Class page; which is the combined total of the raw materials, facilities, and workforce needed to construct it. 

Example: A basic Light Fighter can be purchased for 10,000 credits from a ship dealer. If a player wanted to construct one, they would need to spend only 5,000 credits, which covers the raw materials, facilities, and the workforce needed to construct a basic Light Fighter.

### Constructiion Materials
Each starship requires basic raw materials to contruct it such as metals, plastics, and other materials needed to construct the basic components of any starship. These materials can be purchased, scavenged from a junkyard, or stolen from a cargo ship but are utimately up to the Game Master to determine.

### Constructiion Facilities
In order to construct a starship, a party needs the requisite facilities to do so. Usually this is a massive shipyard found in orbit of the more well established worlds such as Corellia or Mon Calamari. 

However it is possible to find smaller shipyards on less established worlds such as Tatooine or Naboo. It is up to the Game Master to determine if the party can find the suitable facilities required to construct a starship and if it is even available to them.

### Constructiion Workforce & Time (everything after this still needs editing)
```blah blah, fluff text about workforces```

A standard workforce constructs a starship at a rate of 500 credits per day and it is assumed each member of the workforce works 8 hours per day.

#### **Time to Construct**
To determine the time to construct a starship, use the following method/formula:

Multiply the size of the workforce by 500 and then divide the base Starship Class Cost by that value.

**Starship Construction Formula**<br>
"Starship Class Cost" / (500 x "size of workforce")= Days to construct

For instance, to build a Light Fighter, with a workforce of 5, would take 4 days to construct.
<br>(10,000  / [500 x 5]).

#### **Construction Workforce**
The minimum workforce size is shown below on the **Construction Workforce** table.  Starship construction also has a maximum practical workforce, beyond which no time gains are made.

|  |  |  |
|:----|:----|:----|
Starship Size | Min. Workers | Max. Workers
| Tiny      | 3     | 15 |
| Small     | 5     | 25 |
| Medium    | 10    | 50 |
| Large         | 100       | 500 |
| Huge          | 1,000     | 5,000 |
| Gargantuan    | 10,000    | 50,000 |
| Colossal      | 100,000   | 500,000 |

### Optional Construction Rules
```Put the rules for spliting parts of the cost based on what the party can provide themselves```

Addtionally, a party can have a Tiny, Small, or Medium starship constructed with a workforce up to one third of the minimum for that size (rounded up). When constructed in this way, a starship automatically gains the Used condition, as the party did not have the required workforce to do a thorough inspection.

List what happens when you want to "reverse" a step (uninstall, etc)

### Stock Upgrades & Equipment
As part of the construction of a starship, each Starship Class comes installed with a stock amount of Upgrades and Equipment, as listed on their respective page, and come at no additional cost or time to construct. 

Upgrades and Equipment are also be installed after a starship has been constructed, using the same rules as constructing a starship for the raw materials and workforce needed to install.

More specific rules for how Upgrades and Equipment function as well as the options open to players and Game Masters is detailed later in Chapter 4: Upgrades and Chapter 5: Equipment.
