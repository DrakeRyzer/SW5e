# Optional Rules ```(needs reworking)```
The following rules are not required to play a game using Starships of the Galaxy. However for campaigns who want a bit more crunch and realism to the Star Wars galaxy, these rules can add some life to certain aspects of owning and operating a starship

## Record-Keeping vs. Upkeep
The Saga Edition Core Rulebook gives basic costs for upkeep on a personal basis (see Services and Expenses). These costs can be applied to Starships and also serve as a simple way of keeping track of such expenses instead of the more detailed methods described below (see Docking, Fuel, and Maintenance, below). Generally, a Starship of Colossal or smaller size can be maintained in working condition (including Fuel, Maintenance, Docking, and Astrogation Updates) by any character with at least Comfortable Upkeep (2000 credits per month) instead of maintaining a residence. If you don't own your Starship and still make payments for it, the minimum Upkeep required is Wealthy (5000 credits per month) for at least five years.

Similarly, the licensing and registration for a Starship can be abstracted by the normal rules for purchasing a Restricted Item, assuming that any Black Market purchase also includes appropriate forged documents.

## Permits and Licenses
See also: The Bureau of Ships and Services

All Starship owners and operators are required to have at least three different pieces of registration aboard their ships at all times, each of which is obtained through the Bureau of Ships and Services, or BoSS (see below).

Captain's Accredited License: Certifies that the captain is capable of piloting and operating the Starship.
<br>Cost: 200 credits
<br>Requirements: DC 15 Pilot check, 10 years of Starship experience (any character who takes the Spacehound Talent at 1st level automatically qualifies); experience requirement can be waived for additional "Expediter Fee" of 300 credits.
<br>Time: 1 day

Ship's Operating License: Tracks the ship's make, manufacturer, port of origin, Transponder Codes, and owner.
<br>Cost: 1,000 credits
<br>Requirements: Captain's Accredited License, ship must pass inspection (all systems functioning, no Escape Pods missing, no Illegal Starship Modifications, functioning Transponder Code), DC 10 Knowledge (Bureaucracy) check.
<br>Time: 1 day

Arms Load-Out Permit: Registers the ship's weapons.
<br>Cost: By Weapon Availability (see Restricted Items)
<br>Requirements: Captain's Accredited License, Ship's Operating License, Knowledge (Bureaucracy) check (DC varies by Weapon Availability).
<br>Time: By Weapon Availability (see Restricted Items)

Though these registrations are required by law, many Starship captains operating on the fringes of society forge these documents to hide the ship's true identity (or their own). Forging BoSS documents requires a Deception check, counting as both a Deceptive Appearance (to produce a BoSS-secure Datapad that seems authentic) and Deceptive Information (to create plausible ship records). However, such forgeries won't appear in the BoSS computer system, so they will not survive close scrutiny.

## Transponder Codes
See also: Transponder

Every Starship has a Transponder Code, a unique signal that allows that ship to be distinguished from any other. If you look up a specific Transponder Code in a BoSS database, you can find the ship's name, type, Starship Modifications and armament, owner, and even history (including the time of its arrival and departure from every legitimate spaceport in the galaxy).

A ship's Transponder Code is built into the ship's sublight engines, so any attempt to remove or alter the code can fuse the wiring and destroy the engine. Some smugglers and pirates have been known to mask their transponder signal to preserve anonymity, but most governments will attempt to capture or destroy such a ship immediately. Instead, many criminals and others operating outside the law will tamper with their transponder to broadcast false Transponder Codes. Though highly illegal, altering a Transponder Code will allow a ship to identify itself by another name (see Transponder).

### IFF Transponders
Military ships also broadcast a unique transponder code that identifies the ship by its type, designation, and allegiance. These Identify Friend/Foe (IFF) Transponders are separate from the transponders built into Starship engines, and they are not included on civilian Starships.
