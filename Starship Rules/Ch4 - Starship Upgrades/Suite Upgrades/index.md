## Starship Workshop
*Suite: Modification Grade: 2*<br>
*Prerequisites: Docking Bay*

This suite comes with mounted fusion cutters, flood lamps, magnifying viewers, beam drills, tethers, power prybars, clamps, and an integrated mechanicâ€™s kit that can be used to refit, upgrade, and install equipment as well as modifications to a housed starship. It takes 10 minutes to transfer a starship to and from a Starship Workshop to an installed Docking Bay.

While making a check that involves recharging, refitting, upgrading, or installing equipment as well as modifications to a housed starship; you can add your proficiency bonus to checks you make if you do not already do so. If you already add your proficiency bonus to checks you make, you instead add double your proficiency bonus. If you already double your proficiency bonus to checks you make, you instead add half of your governing ability modifier (rounded up, minimum of +1), in addition to your ability modifier.

- Large: A Large Repair Bay can house one Medium starship.
- Huge: A Huge Repair Bay can house one Large starship.
