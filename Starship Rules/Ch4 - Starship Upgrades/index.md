# Starship Upgrades


## Repair Bay
A fully equipped Starship Workshop is able to do tasks just not possible with even the best handheld tools. A good Workshop includes numerous benches and storage racks, a full set of permanently mounted fusion cutters, flood lamps, magnifying viewers, beam drills, tethers, power prybars, clamps, and similar tools. It can be used to repair or modify anything from Weapons to Droids to ship systems.

Mechanics checks and Use Computer checks made to repair, modify, or construct objects in the workshop (or the Starship in which the Workshop is located) gain a +2 Equipment bonus.
