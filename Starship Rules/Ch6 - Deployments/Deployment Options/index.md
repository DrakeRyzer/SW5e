# Deployment Options

## Multispecializing

## Starship Combat Styles

## Deployment Ventures	
2 Ventures per rank (for a maximum of 10). Expand Ventures to be closer to Player Feats with more, and stronger, features to them. Add Ventures that allow a character to treat any ship to have Proficiency/Expertise/Reroll in a skill.

### Starship Savant
Prerequisite: Proficiency in Mechanic's Kit
- When you use a Mechanic’s Kit to stabilize a starship that is making destruction saving throws, that starship also regains 1 hull point and is no longer disabled. A starship can't regain hull points again in this way until it completes a recharge or refit.
- Over the course of 1 minute, you can expend one use of a starship repair kit to restore hull points to a starship. Roll one die equal to the size of the ship's Hull Die + your Proficiency Bonus, plus additional hull points equal to the starship’s maximum number of Hull Dice. The starship can’t regain hull points again in this way until it completes a recharge or refit.
