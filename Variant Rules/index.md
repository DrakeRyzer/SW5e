## Customizable Species ASIs 


The Ability Score Increase trait in a species reflects an archetypal bit of excellence in the adventurers of this kind in the Star Wars universe. For example, if you’re a zabrak, your Constitution increases by 2, because zabrak heroes in Star Wars are often exceptionally tough. This increase doesn’t apply to every zabrak, just to zabrak adventurers, and it exists to reinforce an archetype. That reinforcement is appropriate if you want to lean into the archetype, but it’s unhelpful if your character doesn’t conform to the archetype.

If you’d like your character to follow their own path, you may alter your Ability Score Increase trait and assign ability score increases tailored to your character. Here’s how to do it: take any ability score increase you gain in your species and apply it to an ability score of your choice. If you gain more than one increase, you can’t apply those increases to the same ability score, and you can’t increase a score above 20.

For example, if the Ability Score Increase trait of your species increases your Constitution by 2 and your Wisdom by 1, you could instead increase your Intelligence by 2 and your Charisma by 1.

## Minimum Roll Threshold

Certain features, such as the Great Weapon fighting style, allow you to reroll a die on a certain result, such as rolling a 1.  Any feature with such wording may now be treated as having a **Minimum Roll Threshold**.

Dice from features with a **Minimum Roll Threshold** can no longer roll below a certain amount, instead treating the die’s result as the threshold. This threshold varies depending on the die size: 2 for d4, 2 for d6, 3 for d8, 4 for d10, 5 for d12, and 8 for d20.

For instance, a character with the Great Weapon fight style wielding a two-handed weapon that deals 1d12 rolls a 3 on a damage die, they treat the result as if they’d rolled a 5.
