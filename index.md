SW5e's Decrypted Lore is the home for all content slated for possible release, much like D&D5e's "Unearthed Arcana", for play testing, discussion, and refining before being fully released to the main SW5e website.

If you encounter any typos, bugs, or pages located in the wrong sections, please let DrakeRyzer know on the SW5e Discord in the **#dev-discussion** channel<br>(please provide screenshots and links to the page you're encountering the issue).

The following labels tell you if the content is new, reworked, is a word in progress, or if it's a placeholder for future content.
